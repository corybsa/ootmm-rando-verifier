# Rando Verifier
This is a tool to check OotMM rando seeds for impossible required items.
A Required item is something like Light Arrows in OoT, and Oath to Order in MM.

## What does it check?
There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to checks. For the most part you can define anything you want. That being said, it has hard coded logic for required items locked behind skulltulas when skulltulas are impossible to get (i.e. soul of skulltulas is in a skulltula).
